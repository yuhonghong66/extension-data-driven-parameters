# Data-Driven Parameters
This extension allows you to add a parameter to a Tableau dashboard whose domain is based on your data. Added a new product line? Expanding to new regions? No longer do you need to manually edit the parameter to update it, with this extension your parameter values update automatically!

## Open source discrepancy notice
The source code found in this repository uses the Tableau UI components library. However, due to a bug in the current version of Qt used in Tableau Desktop, html selects do not allow for mouse selection on Mac and instead require the keyboard for selections. Because of this we will be using an alternative div dropdown in the production bundle until we are able to upgrade Qt.
